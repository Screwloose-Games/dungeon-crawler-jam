  
The unit economy is intended to give some idea of the challenge levels of different types of units and ability combinations.
  
A group of units with a given total challenge score should be well-balanced against another group of units with a similar challenge score.
  
  
  
Units have the following characteristics to primarily determine Unit economy
  
1. Action points per turn
2. Health points
3. Abilities
4. Calculated challenge score
  
  
  
## Ability economy
  
Abilities are ranked at different levels of power. This influences the challenge level of the units that can use them.
  
### Ability rank
  
Cost of the ability reduces the rank multiplicatively.
Damage of the ability increases its rank multiplicatively.
Damage per 10 AP: a calculation that
positioning_power: add X if this causes unit repositioning
debuff: add X if this debuffs a unit.
  
## Challenge Level
  
This is determined through some arithmetic. This includes
  
- Cost of abilities
- Damage of abilities
- AP pool
- HP pool
- Mobility
  
### HP influence on Unit challenge level:
  
As HP increases, challenge level increases multiplicitively
  
### AP influence on Unit Challenge Level
  
As AP increases, average_damage_per_turn increases.
  
### Average damage Per Turn
  
As average damage per turn increases, challenge level increases multiplicatively.
  
### Mobility
  
As mobility increases, challenge level increases multiplicatively.
