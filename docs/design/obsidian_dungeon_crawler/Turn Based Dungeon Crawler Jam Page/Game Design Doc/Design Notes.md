==I think that the way we approach healing will inform may more subsequent decisions==
==regarding how the player traverses the world we are building.==
  
==One of our initial discussion laid out the groundwork for how I have been thinking that healing would work.==
  
==Chris suggested that there is no in combat healing mechanic and that, in order for the units to be healed, they must find an area of respite (campfire). This is reinforced narratively with the opening scene starting in a camp fire area. If returning to these is “free” and traversal of the floor map is free, meaning the party can return to a campfire and heal any time they are on the floor map then I see it as detrimental to the experience, if the goal is to make it unforgiving.==
  
==I see several alternatives to this.==
1. ==Sprinkle in healing items or elements. Potions, Spells, Pickups, etc.==
2. ==Give them the ability to traverse the floor map at a cost.==
3. ==Allow free healing at campfires with the understanding that the goal is to create difficulty in other ways.==
