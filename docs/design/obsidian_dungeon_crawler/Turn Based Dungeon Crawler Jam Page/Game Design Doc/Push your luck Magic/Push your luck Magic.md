When a warlock chooses to cast any spell the AP is consumed and a UI comes up. The player can click one of two buttons, increase damage OR cast spell. Design wise we should make it so the first push your luck is at 10% chance of BUST. And the 5th is a 90% BUST. A bust makes the menu go away and the spell is instantly a failure. Could have accompanying UI and feedback saying you failed.  
  
For a first draft â†’ 10,20,40,70,90 for the % that the spell busts and is a failure!  
For the damage increase we should make it linear and we can tweak the increase for each spell. If a play increases the warlock spells damage type it should tweak the base damage AND the increase!
