- Example class / positioning mechanics:
    - A Rogue does more damage, the fewer adjacent enemies, the more damage
    - A wizard can cast spells like AOE, cones, etc.
    - A barbarian does more damage the more enemies they are around
- There are traps on the map.
- some characters can SWAP position with other characters.
- This ability may be limited in use.
